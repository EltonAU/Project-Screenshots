A 3D mobile application which replicate the environment of QUT Gardens Point, plus a simple navigation
system to help students find a specific building. The project was done with a team of 25+ people.

• Features: 
All major buildings in GP campus, some environment items like trees and bricks, complete
navigation system to all buildings, most of the landscape area of GP campus included, player and camera
movement system.

• My contribution: 
Conducting tutorial of using Blender to create the buildings for the team via Zoom,
leading the discussion of the project plan and workload, importing the buildings made in Blender and
building the application in Unity.

• Made for Android, the application is created using Unity, character model is taken from the free model
Unity-Chan! provided by Unity. All buildings are created manually using Blender by the team.
